    "### Quickstart\n",
    "JAX is a library for array-oriented numerical computation (Ã  la NumPy), with automatic differentiation and JIT compilation to enable high-performance machine learning research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of JAX can be summarized as: \n",
    "- `jax.numpy`: JAX provides a unified *NumPy-like* interface to computations that run on *CPU, GPU, or TPU, in local or distributed settings*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `jax.jit`: JAX features built-in *Just-In-Time (JIT)* compilation via *Open XLA*, an open-source machine learning compiler ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `jax.grad`: JAX functions support efficient evaluation of gradients via its *automatic differentiation* transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `jax.vmap`: JAX functions can be *automatically vectorized* to efficiently map them over arrays representing batches of inputs."

    "As a side note, [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) is a fast version of `conda` that uses `conda-forge` as its main channel (this is the channel you should always be using for science work).\n",
